  <h2 style="font-size:18px">About me</h2>
  <hr>
  <p style="font-size:16px">
    Greetings. I am one of the two Deakin PhD and HDR (theoretical physics) scholars for 2020 at the Australian National University (ANU) in Australia.
    I spend most of my time at the Mt Stromlo Observatory in Canberra, where the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics is located.
    I am a first year PhD student with
    <a href="https://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~chfeder/" style="color:grey">Associate Professor Christoph Federrath</a> (ANU) as my primary supervisor,
    and <a href="http://klessen.org" style="color:grey">Professor Ralf Klessen</a> (University of Heidelberg, Germany),
    <a href="https://hera.ph1.uni-koeln.de/~nschneid/" style="color:grey">Dr Nicola Schneider</a> (University of Cologne, Germany) and <a href="https://pmocz.github.io" style="color:grey">Dr Philip Mocz</a> (Princeton, USA)
    as my associate supervisors. Before my PhD I earned a Bachelor of Education, Bachelor of Mathematics (Applied and Computational),
    Bachelor of Science (Physics) and First Class Honours with University Medal in Astrophysics.

  <h2 style="font-size:18px">Interests</h2>
  <hr>
  <p style="font-size:16px">
    Iâ€™m interested in supersonic (magnetised and hydrodynamical) turbulence,
    the structure of the interstellar medium, e.g. the density structures associated with magnetosonic waves
    and hydrodynamical shocks, and in general, the density probability function. I explore ideas about quantifying the the fractal nature of the medium, and
    spend a great deal of time thinking about star formation at the molecular cloud scale. I am also
    interested in the (sub / supersonic) turbulent dynamo, and the role it plays in amplifying magnetic fields in the Universe,
    HI pillars, which are conjugates for star formation activity, computer vision applications
    in astronomy and general object classification, as well as high-performance computing,
    computer visualisations, stochastic fields, Fourier analysis, and Ecology.

  <h2 style="font-size:16px">About me</h2>
  <p style="font-size:16px">
    Greetings. I am one of the two Deakin PhD and HDR (theoretical physics) scholars for 2020 at the Australian National University (ANU) in Australia.
    I spend most of my time at the Mt Stromlo Observatory in Canberra,
    where I am a first year PhD student.
    <a href="https://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~chfeder/" style="color:grey">Associate Professor Christoph Federrath</a> (ANU) is my primrary supervisor,
    and <a href="http://klessen.org" style="color:grey">Professor Ralf Klessen</a> (University of Heidelberg, Germany),
    <a href="https://hera.ph1.uni-koeln.de/~nschneid/" style="color:grey">Dr Nicola Schneider</a> (University of Cologne, Germany) and <a href="https://pmocz.github.io" style="color:grey">Dr Philip Mocz</a> (Princeton, USA)
    are my associate supervisors. Before my PhD I earned a Bachelor of Education, Bachelor of Mathematics (Applied and Computational),
    Bachelor of Science (Physics) and First Class Honours with University Medal in Astrophysics.

  <h2 style="font-size:16px">Interests</h2>
  <p style="font-size:16px">
    Iâ€™m interested in supersonic (magnetised and hydrodynamical) turbulence,
    with applications on the structure of the interstellar medium,
    like the density structures associated with magnetosonic waves
    and hydrodynamical shocks, the fractal nature of the medium, and
    understanding star formation at the molecular cloud scale. I am also
    interested in the turbulent dynamo, HI pillars, computer vision applications
    in astronomy and object classification, as well as high-performance computing,
    computer visualisations, and Ecology.

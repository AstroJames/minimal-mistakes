## About me
Greetings. I am one of the two Deakin PhD and HDR (theoretical physics) scholars for 2020 at the Australian National University (ANU) in Australia. I spend most of my time at the Mt Stromlo Observatory in Canberra, where I am a first year PhD student. Associate Professor Christoph Federrath (ANU) is my primrary supervisor, and Professor Ralf Klessen (Heidelberg University), Dr Nicola Schneider (Colgone University) and Dr Philip Mocz (Princeton) are my associate supervisors.

## Interests
Iâ€™m interested in supersonic (magnetised and hydrodynamical) turbulence, with applications on the structure of the interstellar medium, like the density structures associated with magnetosonic waves and hydrodynamical shocks, the fractal nature of the medium, and understanding star formation at the molecular cloud scale. I am also interested in the turbulent dynamo, HI pillars, computer vision applications in astronomy and object classification, as well as high-performance computing, computer visualisations, and Ecology.

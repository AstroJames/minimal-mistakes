Greetings. I am one of the two Deakin PhD and HDR (theoretical physics) scholars for 2020 at the Australian National University in Australia. I spend most of my time at the Mt Stromlo Observatory in Canberra, where I am a first year PhD student. I'm interested in supersonic (magnetised and hydrodynamical) turbulence, with applications on the structure of the interstellar medium, like the density structures associated with magnetosonic waves and hydrodynamical shocks, the fractal nature of the medium, and understanding star formation at the molecular cloud scale. I am also interested in the turbulent dynamo, HI pillars, computer vision applications in astronomy and object classification, as well as high-performance computing, computer visualisations, and Ecology.
